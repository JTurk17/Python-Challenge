# Python-Challenge

For this project I used some online documentation to find functions to help with some basic processes within my code.

PyBank:
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-function-python/ I used this to find the sum of the lists that contained numerical data.
2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-max-method/ I used this to find the max value of an item in the numerical list. Using the same logic I found the min value of the same list.
3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-writing-text-files-python/ I used this to assist with writing to a .txt file. Specifically I needed to see the yntax for writing to a .txt file vs writing to a csv file.
4. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2918362/writing-string-to-a-file-on-a-new-line-every-time I used this to find the "\n" because I wanted my write statements to write to a new line in my .txt file.

PyPoll:
I used the same references for PyPoll that I did for PyBank.
